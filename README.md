# MaxPathSum
The max path sum analysis using dynamic programming. In this case, there is a 2D matrix in which you can start at any position. The program then keeps track of the max path matrix algorithm and find the longest path. The only possible movements allowed are down the matrix or to the right if the chosen value is smaller than the current position.
